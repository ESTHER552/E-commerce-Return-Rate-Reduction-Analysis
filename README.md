# 📦 **E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis**

### **Comprehensive Data Analytics + Machine Learning + Power BI Dashboard**

This project analyzes **10,000+ e-commerce orders** to identify the key drivers of product returns and builds a **machine learning predictive model** that accurately flags high-risk orders *before* they are returned.
The analysis includes SQL exploration, Python-based predictive modeling, feature engineering, and an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insight.

# 🚀 **Project Overview**

High return rates significantly impact profits, logistics, and customer satisfaction in e-commerce.
This project answers three critical business questions:

1. **Why do customers return products?**
2. **Which customers/orders are likely to return items?**
3. **How can the business prevent unnecessary returns?**
---

# 🧠 **Key Insights**

### 🔹 1. Discounts Drive Returns

Orders with heavy discounts (>30%) show the **highest return tendency**.

### 🔹 2. Model Can Predict High-Risk Orders

* 3,300 orders flagged as high risk
* **92.61% actually returned**
* Enables prevention before orders ship

### 🔹 3. Supplier Quality Varies

A few suppliers account for a significant share of returns.

### 🔹 4. Category & Region Differences

Certain product categories and regions show elevated return rates.
